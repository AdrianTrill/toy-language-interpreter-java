## Overview

The **Toy Language Interpreter** is a Java-based project that provides a hands-on approach to understanding language interpretation and execution. It features a graphical debugger, multithreading capabilities, dynamic memory management, and fundamental programming constructs. This project is ideal for students and developers looking to gain deeper insights into how interpreters work.

## Features

- 🖥️ **GUI Debugger** – Step through code execution with variable inspection.
- 🛠️ **Comprehensive Data Type Support** – Includes integers, floats, booleans, strings, and references.
- ➗ **Expression Evaluation** – Supports arithmetic, logical, and relational expressions.
- 📝 **Print Statements** – Output values and messages within the interpreter.
- 🔄 **Control Structures** – Implements if-else conditionals and loop constructs (while, for).
- 🔧 **Dynamic Memory Management** – Allocates and deallocates memory efficiently.
- 🗑️ **Automatic Garbage Collection** – Frees memory from unused variables seamlessly.
- ⚡ **Multithreading** – Supports concurrent execution with synchronization mechanisms.
- 🔒 **Synchronization Mechanism** – Ensures thread safety using synchronized operations.
- ✅ **Type Checking System** – Detects type errors before execution to prevent runtime failures.

## Future Enhancements

🚀 **Planned Features:**

- 📜 **Structured Parsing** – Introducing a more advanced parser for better syntax handling.
- 🏗️ **Expanded Language Support** – Adding functions, arrays, and OOP concepts.
- ⏩ **Performance Optimization** – Improving execution efficiency and memory usage.
- 🔍 **Enhanced Debugging Tools** – More insightful runtime analysis and tracking.
- 🛡️ **Error Handling Improvements** – Adding structured exception handling mechanisms.
- 📂 **File I/O Support** – Enabling reading from and writing to files.

## Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chris91ss/toy-lang-interpreter-java.git
```

### 2️⃣ Open in IntelliJ IDEA
- Open IntelliJ IDEA.
- Navigate to **File > Open** and select the cloned repository.
- Ensure Java 11+ is set up in **Project Structure**.

### 3️⃣ Running the Interpreter

#### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
```bash
javac src/main/java/view/cli/CliInterpreter.java && java src/main/java/view/cli/CliInterpreter
```

#### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
```bash
javac src/main/java/view/gui/toylanguageinterpreter/GuiInterpreter.java && java src/main/java/view/gui/toylanguageinterpreter/GuiInterpreter
```

### 4️⃣ Experiment with the Interpreter
- Write and execute `.toy` scripts.
- Use the **GUI Debugger** to step through execution.
